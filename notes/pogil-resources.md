[Active learning increases student performance in science, engineering, and mathematics](https://www.pnas.org/content/111/23/8410.full) - in the medical field, "pure lecture" is "not allowed" because it works so badly.

>"If the experiments analyzed here had been conducted as randomized controlled trials of medical interventions, they may have been stopped for benefit—meaning that enrolling patients in the control condition [the medical equivalent of traditional lecturing] might be discontinued because the treatment [use of active learning technique] being tested was clearly more beneficial.”

>"Given our results, it is reasonable to raise concerns about the continued use of traditional lecturing as a control in future experiments."
