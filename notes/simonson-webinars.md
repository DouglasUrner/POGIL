### What is POGIL?

Cooperative learning strategy

67% of college graduates do not work in the field of their bachelor's degree.
9/10 top ten employer desired skills are non content

Process skills that POGIL focuses on:
1. Assessment - self-assessment and metacognition
2. Critical Thinking
3. Information Processing
4. Management
5. Oral & Written Communication
6. Problem Solving
7. Teamwork

Activites need to be designed to elicit the process skills.

When you are using unusual pedagogical techniques you have to communictate with the students about what the process is and why it will be valuable to them.

You also have to assess the process skills. You can't just assume that the students will "get it". You have to check that they can, for example self-assess.

The model should display the concepts that you want the students to learn.

### How do you get started designing an activity

Go to a workshop...

### Roles in Teams
* Manager
  - On track
  - Keeps time
  - Everyone contributes
* Spokesperson / Presenter
  - Speaks for the team, communicaes
  - Presents the team's ideas
* Recorder
  - Writes down what the team is doing
  - Minutes
    - Muddy points
    - Most important thing learned
* The Forth Role Is Variable
  - Process Reflector
    - How is the team doing? Working together? Everyone contributing?

Have to teach the students how to do the roles. Roles help students to know what is expected of them and they step up and fulfil the role.

### Guided Learning

Following learning cycle:
* Exploration
* Concept Invention
* Application

Learning Outcomes:
* Specific
* Student Centered
* Active
  - Students actually do something
  - Able to demonstrate that they completed the activity
* Acheivable

POGIL vs.:
* Problem Based Learning (PBL)
  - Give students a problem, students have to figure out what knowledge they need to solve the problem. POGIL is more directed (in the Exploration and Concept Invention phase), problems or case studies are useful in the application phase of the learning cycle.
* Case Study Learning
* Cooperative Learning
  - POGIL is cooperative learning and it works well to establish cooperative learning.
  - The cooperative phase happens in the classroom - you get to observe and assess it.
* Team Based Learning
* Decoding the Disciplines
  - How does an expert think about the concepts as opposed to a novice
* Direct Instruction
  - Use rarely
  - In labs, there may be a place - around safety, or effective procedures.
  - Check in and use a mini-lesson if not all on the same page.

When to use POGIL?
* Introducing new concepts

Activities should be challenging enough that a team is required.

Teaching the Constitution, the model is the Constitution

Clicker questions for checkins - use a clicker app.

Hook to start activites.

Activity should be completable in one block - steps of 7-10 minutes.

### Assessment

* Quiz based on last activity
* Application questions
* Sample from each group becomes score for whole group
* Metacognitive journal

### Teams
* Leave together long enough to learn how to work together
* Change 3 or 4 times per semester (after each unit?)
* Consider assigning teams intentionaly

### Ideas
* Algorithims
  - Read a flow chart
  - Processes with algorithmic components (e.g. pack a group of lunches)
* Abstraction

Megan Hoffman, Berea College & Susan Richardson, Whichita HS: authors of the teams chapter in the book.

Tuckman - paper on teams

Design your activities so that the work _needs_ a team. Match the size of the team to the task. There should be _necessary_ work for each person on the team.

### Teams vs. Groups

Teams == internal accountability, accountable to the process and the product. Like "real world" where the failure of a team could lead to the failure of the enterprise (and unemployment).

Teams accomplish more together than they could individually. Mutual support is important.

Developing confidence in asking, and answering, qustions.

### Roles

Having roles is essential, there are some commonly used roles:
* Manager
* Spokesperson
* Recorder

The teacher/facilitator **has** to support the roles, e.g., only communicate through the spokesperson.

POGIL activites that teach the roles.

Rotate roles in a predictable day.

Think about how to support students in their roles.

Match the roles assignments to the cognative load on the student. Try to design questions so that the students have to think about the answer, _not_ the question. Don't make them work on understanding the question. That's not where the challenge should be.

### Forming Teams

* Team size

* "Slackers:"
  - Is something preventing you from participating?
  - Assign the slacker the spokesperson role.
  - Put all of the slackers in one team.

It doesn't work in _every_ class. Team work can be _very_ challenging for students with low social skills.

### Changing Teams

* Too often
* Not at all
