## Guided Inquiry

### Learning Cycle

Guided Inquiry Learning

1. Exploration
2. Concept Invention
3. Application

Activity before Concept, Concept before Vocabulary

### The Model Under Study

In the context of a POGIL lesson, the **model** is the focus of the learning cycle and drives the explaration phase

### Johnstone's Information Processing Model

Working (short term) memory is where we "make sense" of new inputs. Working memorory has the capacity to hold about five to nine (seven Â± two) distinct chunks at one time. The _preception filter_ prevents information that is not relevant to the task at hand from entering and overloading working memory.

This means that it is essential for the questions guiding the inquiry to help students to "tune" their precetion filters to allow them to pass the relevant new concepts.

New information is more easily recognized as relevant when it connects to - either augmenting or challenging - prior knowledge.

Working memory and the filtering of irrelevant information continues developing through ealy adulthood (18-20) -- high school students may not have the capacity of an adult. Making sketches and writing down "tentative statements" may help to free up working memory. Therefore, attempt to incorporate these activities into your lessons.

"Chunks" are "disconnected ideas" connecting ideas in working memory reduces the number of chunks and increases the amount of information available in working memory.

## Process Oriented

### POGIL Roles

Different activities may use different roles, but these are typical:

* **Manager**
  Keeps the group on track, manages time, encourages all to contribute to discussions.
* **Recorder**
  Records answers to questions - ensures that the group has good and consistent notes.
* **Speaker**
  Speaks on behalf of the team to the facilitator, other teams, or the whole class when reporting out.
* **Process Analyst**
  Keeps an eye on group process.

Keeping teams together for a unit or sequence of lessons will allow the team to develop a working process.
